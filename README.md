# 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree
You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5000].
1 <= Node.val <= 107
root is a binary search tree.
1 <= val <= 107

# 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
 
Constraints:
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
