# 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree
You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.
Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []

# 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

# 217. Contains Duplicate
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

# 58. Length of Last Word
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
